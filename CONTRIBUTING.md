## Development Setup
To set up the project locally:

To install the Cognitive Framework, use the following command:
## ðŸ§° Juju Installation

[Juju](https://juju.is) is required to deploy the Cognitive Framework using the Cognitive Charm.

Install Juju depending on your operating system:

### ðŸ“¦ Ubuntu / Debian

```bash
sudo snap install juju --classic
```

```bash
juju bootstrap
juju add-model kubeflow
juju deploy cognitive --channel=edge --trust
```
This single command installs and configures:  
- Kubernetes control plane (if required)  
- MinIO for artifact storage  
- PostgreSQL for MLflow backend  
- Kubeflow Pipelines and MLflow services  
- Ingress and TLS certificates  

Check status with:

```bash
juju status --color
```

## Style Guidelines
- **Code**: Follow existing conventions (e.g., indentation, naming).

- **Commits**: Use descriptive messages in the imperative tense (e.g., "Fix parsing bug").

- **Documentation**: Keep comments and docs up-to-date with changes.
